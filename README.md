# Qiskit_Global_Summer_School_2024

## Schedule Graphic
This repository contains all of my scored labs for the Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 (labs 1, 2, and 4).

Regarding the configurations, I used the cloud-based platform called qBraid to run the codes on the day of the event and the Default version of Python that was available on the platform. However, it is possible to run the code in other environments, such as using miniconda locally on your own machine. In addition, it is necessary to use the API token copied from the IBM Quantum Platform via the IBM [website for quantum computing](https://quantum.ibm.com/).

This project was developed following the [official IBM tutorial](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qgss-2024/blob/main/labs/lab3/lab3.ipynb).

Note: There were some questions like the sixth in the first laboratory that I did individually by importing the code blocks of the question itself
